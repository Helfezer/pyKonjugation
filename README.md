# pyKonjugation
Helping scripts for Deutsch conjugation.

## Set-up

Only dependencie: *pattern*. This lib was develop for python 2.7 and 3.6.
As German use umlaut and ÃŸ => codec issue in 2.7. Unicode conversion is simpler to manage in 3.6.

I used a python 3.6.8 executable and installed pattern using it's setup.py script.
